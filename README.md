# IXmon

The IXmon project aims to be an automated solution for DRDoS detection and
mitigation in IXP-like environments.

This project has been built on top of a fork of
[FastNetMon](https://github.com/pavel-odintsov/fastnetmon). However, the data
extraction from NetFlows as well as the DRDoS attack detection algorithm are
very different. More detailed information about how IXmon works can be found in
our [IXmon paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.12555).
